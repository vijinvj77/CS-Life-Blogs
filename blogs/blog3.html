    <h1>Java Session 2</h1>
    <p>On the second session I learned Conditional statements such as IF, ELSE IF, Nested IF ELSE, SWITCH, TERNARY OPERATOR.
        Then learned about Loops such as For, While, Do While. In this session also learned how to read values to an array using loops, how to display values, break and continue statements.
        Later learned about Function, how to declare and define functions, built-in functions such as array.length, string.toUpperCase etc.
        Then learned how to read/write a file using File class.
        After that learned Exceptions, try catch statements, checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions, throws keyword etc.

    </p>

         Which contains "An introduction to classes", what is a class, object, constructors, static method/variable,this keyword, inheritance and type of inheritance, polymorphism, super keyword.
