    <h1>Java Session 2</h1>
    <img src="../images/blog2.jfif">
    <p>On the second session, I learnt about casting an array datatype, String, Arrays, Relational and Logical operators in Java, Precedence order of Logical operators, Comments in Java, Errors and debugging.

        <br><br><b>Strings</b> are used when we need to store more than one character. String values are always stored inside double quotes(““). The String concatenation is an important aspect in String. Addition of two or more strings is done by string concatenation. A “+” is used for this purpose.
        
        <br><br><b>Arrays</b>- All the elements in an array can be only of one data type. i.e. if an array is declared as String, only string type data can be stored at each index and no other data type is compatible.
        
        <br><br>Declaring an array: datatype nameOfArray[];
        
        <br><br><b>Relational and Logical Operators</b>- 
        
       <br><br> <b>Relational Operator</b>: >,<,>=,<=,==,!=. These are the relational operators.
        
        <br><br><b>Logical Operator</b>: &&(AND), ||(OR), !(NOT). <br>These are the logical operators. AND operation results in a true value only both of the conditions involved are true. OR operation results in a true value even when one of the condition involved is true. Precedence of the logical operators is <ol><li>NOT</li><li>AND</li><li>OR</li></ol>.
        
        <br><b>Comments in java</b>- It is a good practice to follow while writing programs to write comments. A “//” is used to write comments in java.
        
        <br><br><b>Errors and debugging</b>- There are mainly two types of errors. <ul><li>Compile-Time Errors</li> <li>Run-Time Errors</li></ul>
        
        <br><b>Compile-time errors</b> are syntax errors. Compile-time errors occurs when codes are written in ways in which the Java compiler does not recognise. The compiler will display errors to alert you about something that will not compile, and, therefore, cannot be run.
        
        <br><br><b>Run-time errors</b> will only occur when the code actually running. These errors are the most difficult as they lead to unexpected program crashes and bugs in your code, both of which can be hard to track down and fix.
        
        <br><br><b>Debugging</b>- Debugging is finding and removing errors or bugs in a code.</p>
