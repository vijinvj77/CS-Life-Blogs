    <h1>Introduction to Java</h1>
    <pre>Today I started my course on UPgrad on Java. What I learnt in the first session was introduction on Java. 
         In today’s session, I learnt about JDK and how to install it, components of JDK, how code written in Java gets converted into machine code, etc.  
         JDK stands for Java Development Kit. JDK contains the JRE and a Java compiler. The Java compiler converts the source code to a byte code.
         This byte code gets converted to the final machine code by the JVM(Java Virtual Machine), which contained by the JRE(Java Runtime Environment). 
         Computer understands everything in machine language, and all the data on a computer stores as binary bits, i.e. 0 and 1.</pre>
    <pre>Later studied how to run a Java program to print “hello world” in command line. Learnt how to set the path variable.

        Program to print hello world:
        
        public class FirstProgram{
        
        public static void main(String[] args){
        
        System.out.prinln(“Hello World”);
        
        }
        
        }
        
        Then learnt about IDE(Integrated Development Environment). Installed IntelliJ Idea IDE.
        
        Then learnt about variables, how to declare variables, initialize them, updating a variable, naming conventions for variable initialization. 
        
        Later studied about primitive data types in Java. Which are:
        
        1)Integer- int, long, short.
        
        2)Float & double
        
        3)Char
        
        4)Boolean
        
        5)Byte.
        
        The next session was about operators in Java. Learnt about Arithmetic operators.  </pre>
